If you attempt to edit these files it will break the theme,
they are intigrated into the copy protection system to prevent
unathorised use.

There is no reason to edit these files, all template files
in the main theme folder like index.php, single.php, header.php
etc... can be safely edited without affecting the protection system.

If you suspect a theme bug is located in one of these files please
contact the developer who will attempt to fix the problem and release
a bug fix.
